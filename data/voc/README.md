A list of potentially intersting SARS-CoV-2 sites that:

- Contain mutations
- Where shown to mutate in experimnetal evolution studies

The sites in `voc.tsv` were validated against SARS-CoV-2 genomes as explained in [corresponding notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/master/data/ipynb/intrahost_voc.ipynb).
The notebook also contains explanation and source of these sites.
